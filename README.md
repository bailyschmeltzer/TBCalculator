# TBCalculator


Attached is the msi installer file. Run this and the TBCalculator application will be placed on your desktop.



IMPORTANT!

This assumes that your guild can get one quarter of the total guild GP from combat missions in every phase. This is currently designed for smaller/more casual guilds. Guilds with higher CM completion rates will be able to score higher than my math due to this. I plan to also include an update that will allow more direct control over the CM numbers, but that is a ways down the road.

The program also assumes that in phases 1-5, if a planet cannot be 3 starred, it will be preloaded and attempted in the next phase, even if you could get 2 stars. Is this the most efficient? Maybe? Maybe not. I found it easier on the math to assume each planet is all or nothing for purposes of getting this built and shared relatively quickly. If you have suggestions on the logic needed to determine the most efficient star, please feel free to email me at ttvbschmeltzer@gmail.com

Future updates I have planned are to convert the program to be using a custom GUI instead of CLI. This will likely be the v2.0 release, but no current estimation on this release is available at this time.

This is completely free, but as this is my first shared project, please feel free to tip. Again, not necessary whatsoever, but wanted to give the option.

Below is an example of a TB plan using a 530 million GP guild.
